# Student-Admission-Form-
This is a simple Student Form application built using Java Swing as part of our OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) practice. It collects student details like name, department, and phone number, and saves the data into a .txt file. This project demonstrates GUI design, form handling, and file operations in Java.
